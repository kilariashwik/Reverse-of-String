Contribution:
My team members including me seperately have wrritten our own codes on our own logic. After 
writing the codes we discussed among our selves and analysed the codes made corrections in the code 
and we executed all the three codes we find some logical error in the codes by comparing all three codes 
we corrected and make a single code and executed the code at last we got the out put.
The code was written in c language so we can execute the code normally
Challenges faced and addressing problems:-
Many errors occurred because of missing  logics
We cleared our errors one by one and got the output and we struggled for lot of time
Conclusion:-
• Team work until makes things simple and easy to do in short span
• Ideas of each are made complex things simple
• Due to team work the work become easy
• No google logics were used while writing program
Inovacation and the rules of reversing of string
• From the given question Our main theme is to find out the  leftrotation of the given string.
For example:when the input is given abcdef the output should be defabc
• Rules of left rotation of string
1) we implemented reverse method usind decrease and conquer
2)first enter the characters 
3) Enter the number of characters that should perform left rotation
